 ### Discussion 
#### TechRadar
 goes through troubleshooting steps for network printers;
 it checks that the printer is connected and drivers are installed properly
 That can also be done by removing and adding the printer in Windows settings, 

 
#### According to Lifewire. 
 I would follow that with asking her if her printer is correctly connected and if she could reinstall the printer drivers. 
 If it no longer appears, then I will have her enter settings within Windows herself and add the printer.
